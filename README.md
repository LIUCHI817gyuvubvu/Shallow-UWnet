# Shallow-UWnet
Implementation of the paper *[Shallow-UWnet : Compressed Model for Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02073)*

## Introduction
In this project we have proposed a shallow neural network architecture, Shallow-UWnet which maintains performance and has fewer parameters than the state-of-art underwater image enhancement model. We have demonstrated the generalization of our model by benchmarking its performance on combination of synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Train the Model
```
python training.py
```

## Test the Model
```
python test.py
```
## Pretrained Model
The pretrained Shallow-UWnet model is available at [model.ckpt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QmOR8Ar3LqS5Pj0GG3I-798Yyj9xswet/view?usp=sharing)
